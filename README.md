Ratemate is an automated proof of concept tool designed for the analysis of audio tracks. 
It proficiently extracts lyrics from the provided audio and subsequently conducts evaluations based on the PEGI (Pan European Game Information) scale.

```bash
poetry install
```

After installation, make sure to provide your OpenAPI API key in the `.env` file.
